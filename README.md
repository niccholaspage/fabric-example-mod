# Fabric Example Mod
This is a fork of the [fabric-example-mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) repository but has Kotlin support. Unlike the [fabric-example-mod-kotlin](https://github.com/natanfudge/fabric-example-mod-kotlin) repository, it closely mirrors the original repository, and the Gradle settings and build files are in Kotlin DSL instead of Groovy.
## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.
